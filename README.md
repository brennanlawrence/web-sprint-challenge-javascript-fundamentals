# Sprint Challenge - JavaScript Fundamentals

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in project. This Sprint explored JavaScript Fundamentals. During this Sprint, you studied array methods, this keyword, prototypes, and class syntax. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by completing a survey of JavaScript problems.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. 

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._


## Introduction

You will notice there are several JavaScript files being brought into the index.html file.  Each of those files contain JavaScript problems you need to solve.  If you get stuck on something, skip over it and come back to it later.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead as the evaluate your solution.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. Briefly compare and contrast `.forEach` & `.map` (2-3 sentences max)

They are both used in different contexts. The forEach method loops through an array and does something on each item in the array, while the map method creates a new array out of an old arrayâ€”though you can apply something on each item like forEach. They can be similar, but the forEach method doesn't touch the original, it works in a new array.

2. Explain the difference between a callback and a higher order function.

A callback is when you invoke an outside function inside of another function. A higher order function is the function that invokes the outside function in a callback.

3. What is closure?

When you invoke a variable, function, array, object, etc inside of a function that was defined outside of the function, the function will reach outside to find the definition. The function will go outside of its scope to find the definition of a variable, but only after it has searched inside itself and found only emptiness. 


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.

    1. When this is called in global scope, this refers to the window object.
    2. When a function is called with a dot, this refers to the object before the dot.
    3. When this is in a constructor function, this refers to the instance of that thing inside the function.
    4. When call or apply methods are used, they define what this is refering to explicitely.

5. Why do we need super() in an extended class?

super() tells the child class that it should reach out and take its parent's functions. This allows us to use the functions of the parent which is impossible without super.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

**Pro tip for this challenge: If something seems like it isn't working locally, copy and paste your code up to codepen and take another look at the console.**

#### Task A: Objects and Arrays

Test your knowledge of advanced array methods and callbacks.
* [ ] Use the [arrays-callbacks.js](challenges/arrays-callbacks.js) link to get started.  Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task B: Closure

This challenge takes a look at closures as well as scope. 
* [ ] Use the [closure.js](challenges/closure.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task C: Prototypes

Create constructors, bind methods, and create cuboids in this prototypes challenge.
* [ ] Use the [prototypes.js](challenges/prototypes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

#### Task D: Classes

Once you have completed the prototypes challenge, it's time to convert all your hard work into classes.
* [ ] Use the [classes.js](challenges/classes.js) link to get started. Read the instructions carefully!

In your solutions, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals 

There are a few stretch problems found throughout the files, don't work on them until you are finished with MVP requirements!

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
